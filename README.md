# LoyolaLightningMachine
Codebase for the Loyola Lightning Machine (LLM), developed to study the dynamics of TGFs for Dr. Abbasi's research group. 

This codebase contains all of the files necessry to run the GUI to handle multi-instrument data analysis toolkit for TGFs. 
## Overview

This repository contains analysis tools for processing atmospheric physics data from 5+ instrument types:
- **Interferometer (INTF)** - Lightning channel imaging
- **Fast Antenna (FA)** - Electric field measurements  
- **Surface Detectors (TASD)** - Gamma-ray detection array (507 detectors)
- **Spectroscopy** - Wavelength-resolved emissions via v711 camera
- **Photometry** - Multi-channel optical wavelength measurements
- **Luminosity** - Intensity of light via v2012 camera.
